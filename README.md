The purpose of this repo is to apply the concepts associated with Frequentist Inference using Python. Frequentist Inference is the process of deriving conclusions about an underlying distribution via the observation of data. In particular, in this notebook I'll be writing Python code using [scipy.stats]((https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/tutorial/stats.html)) to apply the following statistical concepts:
 
- [x] The _z_-statistic
- [x] The _t_-statistic
- [x] The difference and relationship between the two
- [x] The Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences
- [x] How to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
- [x] The concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
- [x] How to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval

The first notebook included in the repo (`frequestist-inference_exercises.ipynb`) includes basic esercises involving the points mentioned above and the second notebook (`frequestist-inference_exercises.ipynb`) will exemplify the same but with a mini case study using data from the [Sample Insurance Claim Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/easonlai/sample-insurance-claim-prediction-dataset) downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
